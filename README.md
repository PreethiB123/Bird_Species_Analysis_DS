# Bird_Species_Analysis_DS
Overview : This project allows users to explore and analyze bird species data from forest and grassland habitats. It leverages Streamlit and Plotly for data visualization and provides insights into bird distribution, seasonal trends, habitat preferences, and environmental factors influencing bird behavior.

Installation Instructions: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-species-analysis.git cd bird-species-analysis

Project Structure: ** app.py: The main file for running the Streamlit application and generating data visualizations.

** requirements.txt: Contains the necessary Python packages for the project.

** data/: This folder (if included) contains any additional datasets or files relevant to the analysis.

Usage Instructions: Once you have the Streamlit app running, you can interact with it through the sidebar to explore different analyses. The app provides several types of analyses you can choose from: Key Analysis: 1.Distribution of Admin Unit and Habitat Type: * Visualize the distribution of bird species across administrative units and location types.

2.Temporal Analysis: *Explore the distribution of bird species over time, such as by year, month, or season. *Visualize trends in bird activity at specific hours using scatter plots and bar charts.

3.Spatial Analysis: * Identify biodiversity hotspots and analyze the number of species per plot.

4.Species Analysis: * Analyze species counts by location and species. * Examine activity patterns and frequency based on observation methods. 5.Environmental Conditions: * Analyze how environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and sky conditions affect bird observations.

REQURIEMENTS : 1.Pandas- for data manipulating and analysis 2.psycopg2 sql - for storing data and connecting the db 3.streamlit - for creating web application 4.plotly -for interative visualization
